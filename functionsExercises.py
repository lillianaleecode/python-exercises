"""Exercise 1: Create a function in Python
Write a program to create a function that takes two arguments, name and age, and print their value."""

"""Arbitrary Arguments, *args
If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:"""

"""Passing a List as an Argument
You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.

E.g. if you send a List as an argument, it will still be a List when it reaches the function:"""

Write a program to create function func1() to accept a variable length of arguments and print their value.
